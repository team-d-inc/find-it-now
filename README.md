- Keep it **simple** and **iterative**.
- Gather feedback and improve continuously.

### Wireframes

  - [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)
  - [Behance](https://www.behance.net/)
  - [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.ca/)
  - [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/)

- **Backend:** Express, Node.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Other Technologies:** Clerk, Tiptap, Socket.io, etc.

> You may use other technologies, but instructor support may be limited for less familiar tools.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

- Identify the entities and the relationships:
  - **One-to-One**
  - **One-to-Many**
  - **Many-to-Many** (requires join tables)
- Draw an ERD diagram to map data relationships.

### API Endpoints

- Plan RESTful API endpoints. Example:

  ```
  GET       /api/v1/notes
  GET       /api/v1/notes/:id
  POST      /api/v1/notes
  PUT/PATCH /api/v1/notes/:id
  DELETE    /api/v1/notes/:id
  ```

### Project management
